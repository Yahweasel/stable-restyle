This tool restyles images or video using Stable Diffusion. The image restyling
is quite simple (it just runs the image through Stable Diffusion), but the video
restyling is a more interesting trick.

To video-restyle, put your input frames as PNG files in an `in` directory, and
run `video-restyle.js`. Use `-fps` and/or `-spk` to control frame behavior. The
output has "slides" and "keys": the "slides" is its output frames, and the
"keys" are frames that are independently converted by AI. That is, AI errors
will accumulate at the frequency of keys. `-fps` is frames per slide (i.e.,
input frames per slide), and `-spk` is slides per key. For instance, if your
input is 24 FPS and you want output at 12FPS, you need to set `-fps` to 2.
Typically, `-spk` is 4.

The inbuilt Stable Diffusion ComfyUI workflows are to convert images to
